						<h2>Fits Your Wrist and Your Fashion Sense</h2>
						<p>Forerunner 935 GPS running/triathlon watch features a lightweight, comfortable design you’ll be happy to wear all day. The 935 is compatible with our line of easy-to-swap QuickFit™ bands. With a band to suit every event, you can easily change from sporty silicone to classic leather and even high-end metal.</p>
						<h2>Monitor Your Performance, Training and Recovery</h2>
						<p>Just how effective is your current training plan? Forerunner 935 will help you monitor your training and recovery so you can better prepare for a race or training cycle. Training status is a new performance monitoring tool that automatically evaluates your recent exercise history and performance indicators to let you know if you’re training productively, peaking or overreaching. The new anaerobic training effect metric opens a window of insight to a critical dimension of training, telling you how your training is improving your ability to push the limits. You can even view your overall training load, which measures your exercise volume from the last 7 days and compares it to the optimal range for your fitness and recent training history.</p>
						<h2>Training Status</h2>
						<h2>Analyse Your Technique</h2>
						<p>We’re making it easier to get the data you need to improve your form. Let Forerunner 935 measure crucial running metrics2 that you can use to analyse your performance. Biomechanical measurements such as cadence, stride length, ground contact time and balance, vertical oscillation and vertical ratio are the key to understanding your form so you can bring your best on race day. These metrics are available with the addition of a compatible heart rate strap2 or the compact Running Dynamics Pod, which clips right onto your waistband. Also, take advantage of feature sets to help with cycling and even swim training. In the water, Forerunner 935 will track your distance, pace, stroke count and more.</p>
						<h2>Running Dynamics Pod</h2>
						<p>Outlast your longest workout with a battery you can rely on, even in the middle of an iron-distance triathlon or ultramarathon. Forerunner 935 features up to 24 hours of battery life in GPS mode and up to 60 hours in UltraTrac battery saver mode. When you’re just using it as your day-to-day smartwatch, you’ll get up to 2 weeks from a single charge.</p>
						<h2>Run, Sprint, Swim, Bike, Tri</h2>
						<p>Your routine is anything but routine. Forerunner 935 lets you change things up with ease thanks to built-in activity profiles for running (indoor/outdoor), cycling (indoor/outdoor), swimming (pool/open water), cross-country skiing, paddle sports, trail running, hiking, strength training and many more.</p>
						<p>For brick workouts and du/triathlon races, the auto multisport feature lets you switch sports with just one button press. The 935 is compatible with advanced workouts for running, cycling — and even pool swimming. Create your own custom workouts and download for free from Garmin Connect™ online fitness community. Then review your past efforts on the app or share them with family and friends for added motivation.</p>
						<h2>Smarter Connections</h2>
						<p>Smart notifications delivered right to your wrist are just the beginning. When paired with your compatible smartphone3, Forerunner 935 also gives you access to automatic uploads to Garmin Connect, audio prompts, music controls and more. Let your loved ones follow your runs and rides in real time with LiveTrack — or use GroupTrack, which lets you keep tabs on your riding buddies as you go.  For getting your data to and from the cloud, if you like the quick connection Wi-Fi® provides, 935 can do that, too.</p>
						<h2>Follow Your Heart</h2>
						<p>Wrist-based heart rate might be an easy choice when you want to move without restrictions on race day, but Forerunner 935 gives you the option to tap into much more data with the addition of a compatible heart rate strap. A chest strap heart rate monitor (like HRM-Run™ or HRM-Tri™) unlocks advanced features such as lactate threshold and the HRV (heart rate variability) stress test.</p>
						<h2>On Your Game, Off the Grid</h2>
						<p>With Forerunner 935, you’re free to go wherever your activities take you — thanks to GPS and GLONASS coverage, which can track better in more challenging environments than GPS alone. Also, a built-in barometer provides you with real-time elevation information. What activities can 935 track? More than you ever thought possible! The triathlon sports are just the beginning, because there is also built-in support for hiking, rowing, golf, skiing, stand-up paddle boarding and lots more.</p>
						<h2>Customise and Connect</h2>
						<p>Forerunner 935 GPS running/triathlon watch automatically syncs to Garmin Connect, our free online fitness community where you can review your progress and even share via social media. Log on to Garmin Connect via your desktop, or download the Garmin Connect™ Mobile app to your compatible smartphone. You can also customise your device with data fields, free watch faces from NUUN, and even apps like Uber and Accuweather, all available from Connect IQ™.</p>
						<h2>A Few More Extras</h2>
						<p>Just like you, Forerunner 935 goes hard, all day long. This watch becomes your partner in recovery with all-day activity tracking¹ that monitors steps, calories and sleep. It’s also compatible with our line of Varia™ cycling awareness devices, including rearview radar, smart bike lights and Varia Vision™ in-sight display. Complete your cycling suite with our pedal-based power meters, Vector™ 2 (dual-sensing) and 2S (single-sensing). Vector 2 pairs seamlessly with your Forerunner to show power, cadence, left/right balance and cycling dynamics, which show how and where you produce power.</p>
						<h2>Make Every Day a Competition</h2>
						<p>Get the extra push you need to beat yesterday with Strava Live Segments. Strava Premium members can sync running and cycling segments to their 935 for live feedback during their activities. Also get alerts for segment starts and finishes, view leaderboard rankings, and see how your current effort compares to your PR.</p>
						<h2>From Plan to Performance with TrainingPeaks
						<p>There is nothing more satisfying than a workout performed to perfection. With the TrainingPeaks Connect IQ app, you can open your daily workout right on the Forerunner 935. Then, let the device guide you through your workout in real time, complete with intensity targets and interval durations straight from TrainingPeaks. After your session, automatically sync your completed workout back into TrainingPeaks for detailed analysis of your performance and to measure your progress toward your goals.</p>
						<h2>Running Power</h2>
						<p>Add power data to your training by downloading our Running Power app from the Connect IQ™ store onto your compatible watch. Developed by Garmin Labs, the Running Power app taps into metrics — such as pace, vertical oscillation, grade and even local wind conditions — to determine the amount of power you’re applying at the ground as you run. When you know how much power you’re expending from minute to minute and mile to mile, you’re better able to pace yourself, which can help keep you from tiring out too quickly. The best news? If you already own the right Garmin devices, adding power to your run is free. All you need is a fēnix® 5/fēnix 5S/ fēnix 5X, fēnix Chronos, Forerunner® 935 and 1 of these 3 accessories: HRM-Run™ , HRM-Tri™ or the Running Dynamics Pod.
